2012 \n\nPresentations and Demonstrations will be in FW11 on the 25th of April. A\nhot buffet is available from 6pm, presentations will start at 7pm.\n\nSupport material\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe hardware uses the NetFPGA boards which provide a programmable\nhardware platform for developing network equipment. Given the Verilog\nHDL code for a simple two port switch the hardware designer will\nextend/modify/discard this code to provide the functionality of a\nfour-port IP router. A set of tools are provided to assist the student\nwith design, verification and synthesis.\nThe software developer will create the code needed to control and\nmanage the router. For control purposes, the software must participate\nin a dynamic routing protocol and respond to ARP and ICMP messages. For\nmanagement purposes the software must export a telnet-like command-line\ninterface such that a user can telnet to the software process and manage\nthe actual hardware. The Stanford VNS (Virtual Network System) is used to allow\nthe student's software to run from any suitable Cambridge computer and yet\ncommunicate with the hardware directly.\n\nPrerequisites\nThis is a practical course involving the development and maintenance\nof a large code base.  The course minimum requirements are:\n<li>Students who are familiar with Verilog (or VHDL) and are comfortable\nwith the general process of designing RTL-based logic and the\nverification process associated with that. The student must understand\nthe difference between behavioral Verilog and RTL Verilog (a subset\nwhich can be synthesized into logic).  The hardware course minimum\nis ECAD/ECAD-Practical.</li>\n<li>Students who are competent software programmers, who have had\nsignificant exposure to system level programming in C.  The students\nmust be comfortable developing and debugging in a multithreaded\nenvironment, and should have experience working within a code-base of\nover 5,000 lines.  The software course minimum is C/C++ </li>\n<li>All students should understand IP-level networking. Equivalent\ncourse requirment is equivalent to Computer Networking (Part Ib) and Principles of Communications (Part II)</li>\n<li>Development is in a UNIX (Linux) environment, familiarity with UNIX/Linux\nwill assist a student greatly; course requirment is UNIX Tools</li>\n\nTeams\nThe class will be broken down into teams of two or three students.\nEach team must have at least one member knowledgeable of the hardware\naspect and one member with ample software expertice.  We leave it up to\nthe teams themselves to decide how to break up the workload between all\nmembers. At the end of the term, however, we do require that each\nteam submit one document detailed the work done by each member.  This\ndocument will weigh heavily when allocating points for team\nparticipation.\nPresentation\nAt the end of this module each group will give a 20 minute\npresentation on the design and implementation for their router.  We are\nparticularly interested in the novel aspects of your design, comments on\nhow you worked together and with other teams, and what went wrong and\nwhat went right, as well as any general feedback for us on the project,\nflow, tools, difficulty, etc.\n\nWeekly Meetings and Office Hours\nIn order to keep track of your progress we are scheduling 10 minute,\nweekly meetings with each group to go over project status, issues etc.\nThe exact times for these meetings will be announced after the groups\nhave been decided.  \n\nIn addition to weekly meetings and the class mailing list the TAs will\nhold office hours during the regular class period in SW02.\n\nClass Router Interoperation\nRouters by nature work cooperatively in large complex environments.\nIn fact, much of the complexity in router design and implementation is\ninter-operating with routers developed by different teams based on\nvarying assumptions of standard protocol specifications.\nInter-operation is such a critical feature of network infrastructure\ndevelopment that it is one of the major focuses of this course.  The\nlast few weeks of the course are reserved for inter-operation and\ntesting between all of the teams in the class.  The students are\nresponsible for initiating communication between groups, coming up with\na cooperative integration plan and ensuring that your routers not only\ninter-operate with our supplied reference solutions, but all other\nrouters in the class.  It is our goal that by the end of the class,\nevery finished router will be able to route traffic cooperatively on a\nlarge shared topology.\nWe have reserved a portion of the total class points to allocate\nbased on  participation during inter-operation.  This means that we\nexpect all the students to be pro-active from the start about planning\nand communicating a solid inter-operation strategy between teams during\ndevelopment.  It is a good idea to collectively map out a strategy early\non in the term and have incremental goals that can tested piece-wise.\nYou may meet during  designated course hours (since no lectures are\nheld), use the class newsgroup for communication, email or meet during\nclass hours.  We would like you to include the TAs in your\ncommunications (implicit if using the newsgroup) so that we can track\nyour progress.\nDocumentation Deliverables\nDesign documentation is our window into the brilliance of your\nparticular design and implementation.  Through the course, each team\nwill maintain two design documents, one for the hardware portion and the\nother for the software portion. Generally, when reading your design\ndocuments, we should be able to clearly understand your approach to the\nproblem, the high level design  and be convinced that you considered\nmultiple options, choose the best one and are aware of the trade-offs.\nBoth design documents should have the following high level\nstructure.\n<dt><em>Software/Hardware Design</em></dt>\n<dd>Overarching design of the hardware or software (depending on the\nwhich design document).  We expect sufficient detail to understand how\nyour design fits together at a component level without a deluge of\nspecifics.</dd>\n<dt><em>Project Specific Documentation</em></dt>\n<dd>For each project stage outlined in the class hardware schedule you\nwill write a section of the design document detailing your design and\nimplementation choices.  Specific requirements for each section are\nlisted in the section write-up.  You will hand in these sections at the\ncompletion of each milestone.</dd>\n<dt><em>Testing Strategy</em></dt>\n<dd>You are responsible for coming up with a complete, integrated\ntesting strategy which you will use to verify correctness throughout the\ndevelopment process.  Remember that you are responsible for\ninter-operating with other routers so you must take this into account.\nYou may choose to divide this section into four subsections, software\ntesting, hardware testing, integrated unit testing and inter-operability\ntesting.</dd>\n<dt><em>Integrated Design</em></dt>\n<dd>A full and comprehensive overview of your design.  Be sure to\ndescribe in detail why you chose to design your router this way, the\ntrade-offs involved and any problems with your design you hadn\u2019t\nanticipated.  You should take an integrated hardware/software approach\nto explaining your design.  We are interested in knowing what is in\nhardware, what is in software, how they interact and what the interfaces\nbetween the two look like. You may choose to write this section last\nthough much of the material can be taken from the  portions of the\ndocument you will write during the design and implementation stages.\nThis section may be the same in both documents.</dd>\n<dt><em>Post Mortem and Lessons Learned</em></dt>\n<dd> A summary of the your design and implementation experience.  What\nwent wrong? What went right?  What would you do differently?  Contrast\nyour view of the project in retrospect to how it looked at first.  In\nthis section, we are primarily interested in what your learned during\nthe project.</dd>\n\nCredit\nThis module is substantially based-upon the Stanford University\ncourse\n<a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs344/\">cs344</a> \n\"Build an Internet Router\". \nParticular thanks\nto Nick McKeown for making this possible.
