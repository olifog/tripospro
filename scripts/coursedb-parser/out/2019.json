The recent practical successes of Deep Learning, leading to improvements in fundamental NLP technologies such as machine translation, have created enormous interest in academia and industry. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of the fundamental techniques in deep learning and neural networks which enable the development of effective NLP applications. They will also have experience of using Google's Tensorflow software - one of the most popular development environments for building deep learning models - to solve NLP tasks."

Large-scale distributed applications with high volume data processing such as training of machine learning will grow ever more in importance. Supporting the design and implementation of robust, secure, and heterogeneous large-scale distributed systems is essential. To deal with distributed systems with a large and complex parameter space, tuning and optimising computer systems is becoming an important and complex task, which also deals with the characteristics of input data and algorithms used in the applications. Algorithm designers are often unaware of the constraints imposed by systems and the best way to consider these when designing algorithms with massive volume of data. On the other hand, computer systems often miss advances in algorithm design that can be used to cut down processing time and scale up systems in terms of the size of the problem they can address. Integrating machine learning approaches for system optimisation will also be explored in this course."

The remaining two sub-modules focus on OS and micro-architectural analysis of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). Measurement and evaluation are a core aspect of the module: through labs and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of core principles in system behaviour, as well as analysis skills and intuitions that will serve them in future systems development and research. Lectures will consider methodology, systems principles, systems implementation, and current research in operating systems."

A programming language is essentially a means of communicating between humans and computers. Traditional computer science research has studied the machine end of the communications link at great length, but there is a shortage of knowledge and research methods for understanding the human end of the link. This course provides practical research skills necessary to make advances in this essential field.
