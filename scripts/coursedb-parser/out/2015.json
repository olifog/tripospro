This course is intended to present the basic mathematics needed to understand this approach. No previous background will be assumed. The course will start from scratch and end with open research problems. Many examples inspired by Internet Routing will be presented along the way."

This course teaches a blend of operating-system design and implementation as well as systems research methodology through a series of lectures and practical material split into four two-week sub-modules. The first introduced tracing, profiling, and performance analysis techniques. The remaining three sub-modules will apply these skills to critical parts of our systems stack corpus: local filesystems/storage, the network stack/protocols, and distributed filesystems (not yet a final list). Measurement and evaluation will be a core aspect of the module: through labs and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of core principles in system behaviour, as well as analysis skills and intuitions that will serve them in future systems research. Lectures will consider methodology, systems principles, and systems implementation. There will likely be 1-2 guest lectures from experts in the field."

This course provides practical research skills necessary to make advances in this essential field.

Sophisticated processing of images by digital hardware is now fairly common, and ranges from special effects in video games to satellite image enhancement. Three of the main application areas are video data compression, image enhancement, and scene understanding. This module introduces the key tools for performing these tasks, and shows how these tools can be applied. This module is offered by the Department of Engineering."

Machine learning (ML) is an interdisciplinary field focusing on both the mathematical foundations and practical applications of systems that learn, reason and act. The goal of machine learning is to automatically extract knowledge from observed data for the purposes of making predictions, decisions and understanding the world. \nThe aim of this module is to introduce students to basic concepts in machine learning, focusing on statistical methods for supervised and unsupervised learning. The module will be structured around three recent illustrative successful applications: Gaussian processes for regression and classification, Latent Dirichlet Allocation models for unsupervised text modelling and the TrueSkill probabilistic ranking model."

Although phrased in terms of `Player' and `Opponent' the dichotomy Player vs. Opponent can stand for Process vs. Environment, Prover vs. Disprover, or Ally vs. Enemy. These alternatives indicate the wide range of potential applications in computer science, logic, and beyond.",
