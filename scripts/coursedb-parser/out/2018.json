This course surveys computational techniques that can be used to process biomedical data with the overall goal of supporting the processes of scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making in biomedical sciences. A variety of data types will be introduced, along with data and text mining techniques that can be used to analyse, extract, discover and integrate biomedical information at levels ranging from molecular through human populations. The course surveys specific problems in biology, clinical medicine and public health and shows how information processing can support practical applications in these areas."

Large-scale distributed applications with high volume data processing such as training of machine learning will grow ever more in importance. Supporting the design and implementation of robust, secure, and heterogeneous large-scale distributed systems is essential. To deal with distributed systems with a large and complex parameter space, tuning and optimising computer systems is becoming an important and complex task, which also deals with the characteristics of input data and algorithms used in the applications. Algorithm designers are often unaware of the constraints imposed by systems and the best way to consider these when designing algorithms with massive volume of data. On the other hand, computer systems often miss advances in algorithm design that can be used to cut down processing time and scale up systems in terms of the size of the problem they can address. Integrating machine learning approaches for system optimisation will also be explored in this course."

Although phrased in terms of `Player' and `Opponent' the dichotomy Player vs. Opponent can stand for Process vs. Environment, Prover vs. Disprover, or Ally vs. Enemy.

This course teaches a blend of operating-system design and implementation as well as systems research methodology through a series of lectures and practical material split into three two-week sub-modules.  The first module considers OS design, instrumentation, and measurement, motivated by a lab on I/O performance and the process model. The remaining two sub-modules focus on OS and micro-architectural analysis of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). Measurement and evaluation are a core aspect of the module: through labs and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of core principles in system behaviour, as well as analysis skills and intuitions that will serve them in future systems development and research. Lectures will consider methodology, systems principles, systems implementation, and current research in operating systems. In 2017-18, this is a single module that starts in Michaelmas Term and carries over into Lent Term. It is not a double module."

It gives a precise framework for comparing one branch of mathematics (organized as a category) with another and for the transfer of problems in one area to another. Since its origins in the 1940s motivated by connections between algebra and geometry, category theory has been applied to diverse fields, including computer science, logic and linguistics. This course introduces the basic notions of category theory: adjunction, natural transformation, functor and category. We will use category theory to organize and develop the kinds of structure that arise in models and semantics for logics and programming languages."
