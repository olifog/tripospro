Although the evolution of Internet Routing protocols does not seem to have taken much inspiration from this work, recent âreverse engineeringâ efforts have demonstrated that an algebraic approach is very useful for both understanding existing protocols and for exploring the design space of future Internet routing protocols. This course is intended to present the basic mathematics needed to understand this approach. No previous background will be assumed. The course will start from scratch and end with open research problems. Many examples inspired by Internet Routing will be presented along the way."

The module aims to introduce the principles, models and applications of computer vision. The course will cover image structure, projection, stereo vision, and the interpretation of visual motion. It will be illustrated with case studies of industrial (robotic) applications of computer vision, including visual navigation for autonomous robots, robot hand-eye coordination and novel man-machine interfaces. Assessment will include practical exercises and a mini-project which in undertaken in Lent Term. There is no written examination for Part III or MPhil students."

Probablistic machine learning is an interdisciplinary field focusing on both the mathematical foundations and practical applications of systems that learn, reason and act. The goal of machine learning is to automatically extract knowledge from observed data for the purposes of making predictions, decisions and understanding the world. \nThe aim of this module is to introduce students to basic concepts in machine learning, focusing on statistical methods for supervised and unsupervised learning. The module will be structured around three recent illustrative successful applications: Gaussian processes for regression and classification, Latent Dirichlet Allocation models for unsupervised text modelling and the TrueSkill probabilistic ranking model."

Although phrased in terms of `Player' and `Opponent' the dichotomy Player vs. Opponent can stand for Process vs. Environment, Prover vs. Disprover, or Ally vs. Enemy.
