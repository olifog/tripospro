The course will focus largely one middle of the compiler – the analysis, transform, and optimisation pipeline – and will require the students to design and implement language-specific optimisations."

The first introduced tracing, profiling, and performance analysis techniques. The remaining three sub-modules will apply these skills to critical parts of our systems stack corpus: local filesystems/storage, the network stack/protocols, and distributed filesystems (not yet a final list). Measurement and evaluation will be a core aspect of the module: through labs and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of core principles in system behaviour, as well as analysis skills and intuitions that will serve them in future systems research. Lectures will consider methodology, systems principles, and systems implementation. There will likely be 1-2 guest lectures from experts in the field."

Yet very few of these succeed in the market, or are well regarded by their users. This course addresses the research questions underlying the success of new programmable tools. A programming language is essentially a means of communicating between humans and computers. Traditional computer science research has studied the machine end of the communications link at great length, but there is a shortage of knowledge and research methods for understanding the human end of the link. This course provides practical research skills necessary to make advances in this essential field. The skills acquired will also be valuable for students intending to pursue research in advanced HCI, or designing evaluation studies as a part of their MPhil research project."
