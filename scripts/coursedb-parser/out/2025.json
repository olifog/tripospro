For example: traditional Lecture-based modules which have the prefix 'L' such as 'L11 Algebraic path problems'; modules with a large proportion of Practical classes have the prefix 'P' such as 'P51 High performance networking'; and Reading clubs or seminar style modules have the prefix 'R' such as 'R254 Cybercrime'.",

Since its origins in the 1940s motivated by connections between algebra and geometry, category theory has been applied to diverse fields, including computer science, logic and linguistics. This course introduces the basic notions of category theory: adjunction, natural transformation, functor and category. We will use category theory to organize and develop the kinds of structure that arise in models and semantics for logics and programming languages.",

Amongst these is the fact that most of these models are driven by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), models that, although extremely expressive and useful, are notoriously complex and opaque. This “black-box” nature of DNNs limits their ability to be successfully deployed in critical scenarios such as those in healthcare and law. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a fast-moving subfield of AI that aims to circumvent this crucial limitation of DNNs by either (i) constructing human-understandable explanations for their predictions, or (ii) designing novel neural architectures that are interpretable by construction."

      "synopsis": "Our society is evolving towards digital payments and the elimination of physical cash. Digital alternatives to cash require trade-offs between various properties including unforgeability, traceability, divisibility, transferability without intermediaries, privacy, redeemability, control over the money supply and many more, often in conflict with each other. Since the 1980s, cryptographers have proposed a variety of clever technical solutions addressing some of these issues but it is only with the appearance of Bitcoin, blockchain and a plethora of copycat cryptocurrencies that a new asset class has now emerged, worth in excess of two trillion dollars (although plagued by extreme volatility). Meanwhile, most major countries have been planning the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies in an attempt to retain control. This seminar-style interactive module encourages the students to understand what's happening, what the underlying problems and opportunities are (technical, social and economic) and where we should go from here. We are at a historical turning point where an enterprising candidate might disrupt the status quo and truly make a difference."

If judged by the headlines, RL has seen an unprecedented success in recent years. However, the vast majority of RL methods still have shortcomings that might not be apparent at first glance. The aim of the course is to inspire students by communicating the promising aspects of RL, but ensure that students develop the ability to produce a critical analysis of current RL limitations."

      "synopsis": "There is a substantial body of academic work demonstrating that complex life is built by cooperation across scales: collections of genes cooperate to produce organisms, cells cooperate to produce multi-cellular organisms and multicellular animals cooperate to form complex social groups. Arguably, all intelligence is collective intelligence. Yet, to-date, many artificially intelligent agents (both embodied and virtual), are generally not conceived from the ground up to interact with other intelligent agents (be it machines or humans). The canonical AI problem is that of a monolithic and solitary machine confronting a non-social environment. This course aims to balance this trend by (i) equipping students with conceptual and practical knowledge on collective intelligence from a computational standpoint, and (ii) by conveying various computational paradigms by which collective intelligence can be modelled as well as synthesized."
