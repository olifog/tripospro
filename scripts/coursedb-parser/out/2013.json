Yet very few of these succeed in the market, or are well regarded by their users. This course addresses the research    questions underlying the success of new programmable tools. A programming language is essentially a means of communicating between humans and computers. Traditional    computer science research has studied the machine end of the communications link at great length, but there is a shortage of knowledge and\n    research methods for understanding the human end of the link. This course provides practical research skills necessary to make advances\n    in this essential field. The skills acquired will also be valuable for students intending to pursue research in advanced HCI, or designing\n    evaluation studies as a part of their MPhil research project."

For example, we will investigate the universal properties of types in functional programming, and the universal properties of connectives like AND and EXISTS in logic. By developing a theory of models for programs and proofs, we will be able to demonstrate why certain statements (like Peirce's law, ((P → Q) → P) → P) have no constructive proof."
